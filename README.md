# Experiment with multiagent-particle-envs

I made an experiment uing a libary of [MAPE](https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs) and [MADDPG](https://github.com/openai/maddpg).

The codes were slightly changed to adjust to my experiment.  
In addition, I made new scenarios (suikawari) and checked their behavior.  
The experiment resutls are described in ipython notebooks in  
**'maddpg/experiments/my_notes/'**.
