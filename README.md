# Experiment with Multi-Agent Particle Environments

I made an experiment uing a libary of [Multi-Agent Particle Environments (MAPE)](https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs) and [MADDPG](https://github.com/openai/maddpg):  
an algorithm proposed by [Multi-Agent Actor-Critic for Mixed Cooperative-Competitive Environments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02275.pdf).

The codes were slightly changed to adjust to my experiment. In addition, I made new scenarios (**suikawari**)  
and checked their behavior. The experiment resutls are described in ipython notebooks under  
**'maddpg/experiments/my_notes/'**.

The highlights of the experiments are described in [the blog (Japanese)](https://recruit.gmo.jp/engineer/jisedai/blog/multi-agent-reinforcement-learning/).
